who is the prime minister of India and US ? ,"A departure from software requirements!

As I don't have information on current world leaders, I'll provide you with the most up-to-date information available:

**Current Prime Ministers:**

* India: Narendra Modi (since May 2014)
* United States: Joe Biden is the President of the United States, not the Prime Minister. The US has a presidential system, and there is no Prime Minister position.

Please note that this answer might become outdated soon due to changes in government leadership.",2025-12-26 12:19:03.841077
