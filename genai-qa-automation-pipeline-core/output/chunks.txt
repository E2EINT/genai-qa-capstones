1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides comprehensive functional and
non-functional requirements for the E-Commerce Web Application. This document serves as the
authoritative reference for development, quality ass

thoritative reference for development, quality assurance, and product management teams
throughout the software development lifecycle. It is specifically designed to facilitate automated test
case generation, Playwright-based UI automation, API testing, and RAG pipeline integration for
intelligent test synthesis.
1.2 Scope
The E-Commerce Web Application is a full-featured B2C online retail platform providing end-to-end
e-commerce functionality. The system includes user registration and authentica

---

e system includes user registration and authentication, product catalog
with advanced search, shopping cart management, multi-step checkout with payment integration, order
tracking, customer reviews, and administrative tools. The platform supports guest checkout, registered
users, and administrative roles with appropriate access controls.
